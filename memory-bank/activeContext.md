# Active Context (2025-04-16 Cleanup & Review Complete)

## Current Focus
- **Cleanup & Review Complete:** Code cleanup (removed comments, unused imports) and review for fast-path optimizations in `packages/zen-core/src` are complete.
- **Status:**
    - **Cleanup:** Removed commented-out code and unused imports from `atom.ts`, `computed.ts`, `map.ts`, `deepMap.ts`, `events.ts`. Added explanatory comment to `_emitPathChanges` in `events.ts`.
    - **Review:** Core fast paths (`get`, `set`, `subscribe`, `notifyListeners`, `batch`) appear well-optimized. Map/DeepMap `set` operations use standard immutability patterns (`{...spread}`). `deepMap`'s `getChangedPaths` remains a potential bottleneck for very large/deep objects, but optimizing it further carries risks and complexity, deferred for now based on "stable performance" requirement.
    - **Previous State:** Functional API refactoring, module separation, and creation optimization were already complete (Commits: `f0c4085`, `36e5650`). Tests passed, benchmarks improved, bundle size low (atom: 143B, full: 687B - pre-cleanup).

## Recent Changes & Decisions
- Performed code cleanup and review as requested.
- Identified no low-risk, high-impact fast-path optimizations beyond existing structure. Deferred complex `getChangedPaths` optimization.

## Next Steps
- Commit the cleanup changes.
- Consider further optimizations (e.g., `getChangedPaths`), packaging, or release steps.
- Address guideline compliance task (fetching `guidelines/typescript/style_quality.md`) if it becomes available.

## Active Decisions
- Cleanup and review completed. No immediate further optimizations planned for core fast paths.

## Guideline Verification Issues
- **Persistent Failure:** Repeated attempts to fetch `guidelines/typescript/style_quality.md` failed (GitHub 404 Not Found). Cleanup/review proceeded based on existing code style and best practices. The compliance task remains pending.
