# Active Context (2025-04-16)

## Current Focus
- **Complete Object Literal Refactoring:**
    - Modified `atom.ts` and `computed.ts` to use object literals instead of `Object.create()`.
    - Fixed resulting TypeScript errors in `computed.ts` and `core.ts`.
    - Verified changes with `bun run test` (passed).
    - Verified performance impact with `bun run bench` (creation significantly faster, others stable).
    - Verified size impact with `bun run size` (slight increase: atom 675 B, full 1.23 kB - acceptable trade-off).
- Updated Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) with refactoring details and results.

## Recent Changes & Decisions
- **Refactoring (Object Literals):** Successfully changed `atom()` and `computed()` creation.
- **Refactoring (Remove Patching):** Successfully removed dynamic patching for events and batching.
- **Verification:** Tests and benchmarks pass after all refactoring.
- **Size:** Recorded post-object-literal-refactor size.
- **Baseline Commit:** Stable pre-refactoring state committed at `ff6a27b`.

## Next Steps
- Commit the completed object literal refactoring.
- Decide whether to refactor `map()` and `deepMap()` similarly.
- Consider optional optimizations (Map performance, packaging).
- Begin release planning.

## Active Decisions
- Using object literals for `atom` and `computed` creation improves performance significantly with acceptable size trade-off.
- Dynamic patching has been successfully removed.
- Core performance remains excellent.
- `atom()` factory resides in `atom.ts`.
- `AtomProto` defined only in `core.ts`, minimal implementation.
- All definitions use `type` aliases.
- Terser minification is enabled.
- `size-limit` for the full bundle is 1.8 kB.

## Guideline Verification Issues
- (Unchanged) Failed to fetch `guidelines/typescript/style_quality.md`. Proceeding without guideline verification for now. Task added to address guideline compliance later.
