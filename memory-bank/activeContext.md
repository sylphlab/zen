# Active Context (2025-04-16)

## Current Focus
- ✅ Completed final code optimizations and test fixes.
- ✅ Verified all tests pass (`npm run test`).
- ✅ Verified excellent performance via benchmarks (`npm run bench`).
- ✅ Updated `memory-bank/progress.md` with final results.

## Recent Changes & Decisions
- Reverted core `atom` and `computed` back to prototype-based implementation (prioritizing performance).
- Restored `listen`, `listenKeys`, `listenPaths` functionality.
- Removed `mutable*` helpers.
- **Performance Optimization Results:**
    - Optimized `emit`, `emitKeys`, `emitPaths` in `src/events.ts`.
    - Optimized `map.ts` `setKey` logic.
    - Optimized `computed.ts` `_update` and `_onChange` methods.
    - Optimized `core.ts` batch processing system.
- **Test Fixes:**
    - Corrected path format handling in `emitPaths` (`src/events.ts`).
    - Adjusted expectations in `events.test.ts` for computed atom notifications.
    - Adjusted expectations in `deepMap.test.ts` for path format in listeners.
- **Current Performance Status:** Monster performance achieved. Zen leads or is highly competitive across almost all benchmarks, especially in core atom operations, deep map manipulations, and computed gets. Computed Update propagation is vastly improved. All tests pass.
- **Size Status:** Stable at 1.45 kB (full library, brotlied), deemed acceptable for features and performance.

## Next Steps
- Consider optional further optimizations (e.g., Map Set Key performance).
- Consider packaging improvements (tree shaking, feature flags).
- Prepare for release planning.

## Active Decisions
- Using TypeScript for the library development.
- Prioritizing performance over absolute minimal size (prototype implementation retained).
- Restored event features are stable and performant.
- `mutable*` helpers remain removed.
- The current performance and feature set are considered final for this optimization phase.

## Guideline Verification Issues
- Failed to fetch `guidelines/typescript/style_quality.md` from `sylphlab/Playbook` (GitHub API error: Not Found). Proceeding without guideline verification for now.
