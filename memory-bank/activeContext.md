# Active Context (2025-04-16)

## Current Focus
- **Complete Core Refactoring (Remove Patching):**
    - Modified `core.ts` to integrate event triggers directly.
    - Modified `events.ts` to remove patching logic.
    - Modified `batch.ts` to use an internal queue instead of global prototype patching.
    - Verified changes with `bun run test` (passed).
    - Verified performance impact with `bun run bench` (core performance maintained, slight batching trade-off).
    - Verified size impact with `bun run size` (slight increase: atom 633 B, full 1.17 kB - acceptable).
- Updated Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) with refactoring details and results.

## Recent Changes & Decisions
- **Refactoring:** Successfully removed dynamic patching for events and batching.
- **Verification:** Tests and benchmarks pass after refactoring.
- **Size:** Recorded post-refactor size.
- **Baseline Commit:** Stable pre-refactor state committed at `ff6a27b`.

## Next Steps
- Commit the completed refactoring.
- Consider optional optimizations (Map performance, packaging).
- Begin release planning.

## Active Decisions
- Dynamic patching has been successfully removed.
- The slight increase in bundle size and minor batching performance trade-off are acceptable for the improved code structure.
- Core performance remains excellent.
- `atom()` factory resides in `atom.ts`.
- `AtomProto` defined only in `core.ts`, minimal implementation.
- All definitions use `type` aliases.
- Terser minification is enabled.
- `size-limit` for the full bundle is 1.8 kB.

## Guideline Verification Issues
- (Unchanged) Failed to fetch `guidelines/typescript/style_quality.md`. Proceeding without guideline verification for now. Task added to address guideline compliance later.
