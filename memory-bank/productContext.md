# Product Context: zen Library

## 1. Problem Solved
Provides a simple, fast, and tiny state management solution for JavaScript/TypeScript applications, challenging the established players like Nanostores by focusing intensely on bundle size and performance.

## 2. Target Audience
Developers seeking minimal, high-performance state management, particularly in environments where bundle size is critical (e.g., edge functions, micro-frontends, performance-sensitive web apps).

## 3. User Experience Goals
- **Effortless API:** Simple and intuitive functions for creating and interacting with state atoms.
- **Minimal Footprint:** Developers should barely notice the library's size impact.
- **Predictable Performance:** Consistent and fast state updates and reads.
