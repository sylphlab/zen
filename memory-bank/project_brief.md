# Project Brief: zen Library

## 1. Overview
Create a new JavaScript/TypeScript state management library named "zen".

## 2. Inspiration
Inspired by Nanostores (https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores).

## 3. Core Goals
- **Minimal Bundle Size:** Achieve a smaller bundle size compared to Nanostores.
- **High Performance:** Focus on runtime speed and efficiency, aiming to match or exceed Nanostores' performance.
- **Simplicity:** Maintain a minimal and easy-to-use API, similar to Nanostores' philosophy.

## 4. Scope
- Core state atom/store creation and subscription.
- Basic derived state computations.
- Initial focus on core functionality, potentially expanding later.

## 5. Nature
This project is an experimental challenge to explore achieving high performance with an extremely small footprint in the state management space.
