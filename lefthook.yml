      # Check and format staged files using Biome
      # --no-errors-on-unmatched: Prevents errors if glob doesn't match any files (e.g., only non-code files staged)
      # --files-ignore-unknown=true: Prevents errors for file types Biome doesn't know (though the glob limits this)
      glob: '*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mjs,cjs,json,md,css,graphql}' # Match relevant file types

# Optional: Add other hooks like pre-push if needed later
# pre-push:
#   commands:
#     validate:
#       run: pnpm run validate # Example: run full validation before push
